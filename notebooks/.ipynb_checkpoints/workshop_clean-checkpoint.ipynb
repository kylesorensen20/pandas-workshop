    "Now more than ever, data has a unique ability to describe our physical, social and technological world. Thanks to relatively recent (and accelerating) advances in computing, those with proper motivation can use data to affect change in any realm they so choose, from ones more directly related to computer science such as machine learning to others with not so obvious connections such as biology and economics!\n",
    "\n",
    "You have likely heard a lot of talk recently about *data science*, but what exactly is data science? A quick search gives this definition: \"an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains\". Now, this is a mouthful, but essentially, data science pulls from the best of computer science, statistics, mathematics and business to <b>make data understandable and actionable</b>. This is the key, because what worth does data have if we can not interpret it and make decisions based on it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## `pandas` and Data Science in Python:\n",
    "The industry standard for this type of work is a library called `pandas`, along with a dependency that will come in handy called `numpy` and a couple lovely data viz tool called `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. There are other libraries that work well for data science in Python that we may explore later, but these are all you will need for now! :) We will load other libraries for modeling and interpolation later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will see the usual convention for importing `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:"
